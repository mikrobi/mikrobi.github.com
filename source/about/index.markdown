Hi there! I'm Jakob, a software engineer living in Berlin, Germany. My main focus is in building backends, web clients and mobile apps using BDD, Ruby, Swift, Objective-C and Git.

Right now I'm maintaining the backends of the [mbrace](http://getmbrace.com) and [Roundhere](http://www.roundhere.me) apps and [leading their iOS mobile team](../lessons-ive-learned-being-a-team-leader/).

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mikrobi "Jakob Class on GitHub") and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/classisch "Jakob Class on Twitter").
