Hi there! I'm Jakob, a software engineer living in Berlin, Germany. My main focus is in building backends, web clients and mobile apps.

I build great stuff for developers with other great people at [GitHub](https://github.com).

Before that I maintained the backends of the [mbrace](../images/about/mbrace.png) and [Roundhere](http://www.roundhere.me) apps and [led their iOS mobile team](../lessons-ive-learned-being-a-team-leader/). I used to work with several other business after I co-founded my [first company](http://class-zec.de/ "Class &amp; Zec GbR") with my fellow [Marin Zec](http://marinzec.de/) at the age of 18.

I enjoy teaching others and regularly [talk](https://speakerdeck.com/mikrobi "Public talks of Jakob Class") about my experience in public.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mikrobi "Jakob Class on GitHub") and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/classisch "Jakob Class on Twitter").
